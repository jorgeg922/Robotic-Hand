# RoboticHand
Robotic prosthetic hand designed and programmed as part of my senior design project (CSUS Spring 2016).

Full documentation can be found inside the documentation folder.

Prototype demo has been included inisde the images folder.



The following is the draft of our project proposal:

Team Members:
Espinoza, Jesus; Gonzales, Jorge; Guzman, Omar; Ladesma, MarcoAntonio

Purpose and Justification

The purpose of this project is to design and build a prosthetic robotic arm to aid those who have lost an arm in accidents or military combat. The prosthetic arm will help those people regain the ability to live a normal life once again with full use of both arms.

Statement of the Problem or Need

Many people have lost the ability to fully enjoy life due to the loss of an arm, either through unfortunate life events or military combat. This has caused many people difficulties integrating themselves into society because of the need to use two arms even for the most simple tasks such as changing clothes. These unfortunate disabilities have created a need for engineers to develop replacement arms. The people will be able to control these prosthetic arms through the use sensors and muscles that may still be left in their arms. This arm will simulate the functions of the original limb and will allow its users to better perform their daily tasks.

Project Deliverable and Beneficiaries

At the end of the project, we hope to have a fully functioning prosthetic robotic arm. With the use of sensors, the user will be able to control the arm and will be able to performs simple tasks such as cracking an egg open with both arms.

Time Factors

We would like to start with the research of this project as soon as possible. Documentation of the hardware as well as the software design will need to be implemented as soon as possible in order to complete the project. The end of the semester is coming near and we would like to have a completed budget in the following week.

Project Assumptions and Constraints

Assumptions:

●	The prosthetic arm will be able to be tested on a person with both arms

●	All members are able to learn the required material in the allotted time

●	All hardware will be available for purchase

Constraints:

●	The prototype must be completed before the end of the Spring 2016 semester

Project Risks

●	There is a risk that the hardware may not be available for purchase or that the project may need more skills in the field of mechanical engineering
