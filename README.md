The purpose of this project was to develop a robotic hand that may be used to aid amputees regain full use of their hands.
This project, through the use multiple advanced sensors reads the eletrical differential potentials from an individual's arm muscles and
converts the signals to their equivalent PWM signal to move the fingers from the robotic hand.

Due to the complex nature of reading electrical signals from people's arms, this project includes a calibration procedure developed by the team mentioned above, which allows the user to more easily control the hand through his/her muscles. Furthermore, due to the different physical attributes of each individual the results may still vary as muscle location may differ per individual. However, in the documentation we have included a general diagram that may help you find the correct location of your muscles.

For set-up instructions and demonstration images/videos, please refer to the files included within this repository.
