The purpose of this project is to develop a robotic hand that may be used by amputees who are trying to regain full use of their hands.
This project through the use multiple advanced sensors will read the eletrical differential potential from the users' arm muscles and will 
transform the signals to their equivalent PWM signal to move the fingers within the robotic hand.

Due to the complex nature of reading electrical signals from people's arms, this project includes a calibration procedure developed by the team mentioned above, which will allow the user to more easily control the hand through his/her muscles. Furthermore, due to the different physical attributes of each individual the results may still vary as muscle location may vary per individual. However, in the documentation we have included a general diagram that may help you find the correct location of your muscles.

For set-up instructions and demonstration images/videos, please refer to the files included within this repository.
